# Changelog

All notable changes to GroupScape web are logged here, newest first.

## [1.0.351] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- Discord kill, drop, and quest completion notifications now show a matching boss/item/quest icon.
- Loot Log session headers (monster, clue tier, chest/raid names) are now clickable and link to the matching Old School RuneScape Wiki page.
- Loot Log now has filter pills (Bosses, Other kills, Chests, Clues) above the search bar, all on by default - toggle them to narrow the list and totals to just what you want to see. Your selection is remembered next time you visit.
- Boss slayer tasks now show that boss's own icon in the Slayer task panel instead of a generic unknown-task icon - covers every boss assignable via the "Boss" task, not just the Desert Treasure II bosses.
- A handful of new items from today's OSRS update now show up correctly with names and icons (the elemental diamond/amulet set, Necklace of fangs).

### Changed
- The Slayer task button now opens a docked panel below the minibar, matching how the bag and stats panels behave, instead of a separate floating popover.
- The "Join our Discord" button now sits in the bottom-left corner instead of bottom-right.
- Internal: removed unused CI workflows for Docker image publishing and cache validation - deploy already builds images locally on the server, these weren't part of the real pipeline.
- Internal: added an automated pipeline that pulls item and boss data from the OSRS Wiki, plus a weekly scheduled check, so item names/icons/alch values stay current after game updates instead of drifting.

### Fixed
- Corrected outdated high alchemy values (and a couple of stale names) across several hundred items.
- Clue scroll toast notifications now show the proper scroll icon and tier color instead of a plain bullet.
- The toast stack's "Clear all" button no longer gets pushed off-screen when a lot of notifications pile up - the list now scrolls within the screen instead.
- The Loot Log now actually shows two farming-session cards side by side on wide screens instead of leaving empty space next to a single column.
- Slayer task panel no longer shows a literal "null" for the assigning master when that name hasn't been captured yet - it's just omitted.
- Slayer task progress now shows kills done so far out of the total (e.g. 2/45) instead of kills remaining out of the total.
- Slayer task panel no longer shows a literal "null" for the task name when it occasionally fails to resolve - the name and wiki link are omitted instead.
- Activity feed and toast notifications no longer merge kills from before and after a death into one streak - a death now starts a fresh kill count for that boss.
- Linking a character to a group no longer floods the activity feed with every level-up milestone it already had - milestones now only post for progress made after linking.

## [1.0.350] - 2026-09-02

### Changed
- The Activity Feed's "no events yet" message now mentions quests and diaries too, not just kills and deaths.

## [1.0.329] - 2026-09-02

### Added
- The Activity Feed and toast notifications now post a Level Up milestone whenever a group member reaches a notable skill level - every 10 levels up to 80, every 5 up to 95, then every level from 96 to 99 - each with its own skill-flavored message and icon, and 99 called out as a maxed skill.
- Internal: site admins can now clear a group's activity feed or loot log, and reset individual members' collection log, combat achievements, skill/XP history, or bank value history, from the admin panel.
- Each group member's side panel now has a Slayer button - click it to see their current task with a monster icon, their assigned master with a portrait, remaining progress, streak, points, and a link to that task's wiki guide (or just their streak and points if they're between tasks).

### Changed
- Loot Log now loads much bigger chunks of history per scroll and auto-loads further before asking you to click "Load more" again, so scrolling through a group's full loot history takes far fewer steps.
- The item icon shown next to a Collection Log completion in the Activity Feed is now bigger and easier to see.

### Fixed
- Fixed Level Up milestones sometimes getting skipped in the Activity Feed when a skill jumped past more than one milestone in a single update (e.g. a big XP gain crossing both level 80 and 85 at once now posts both, not just the higher one).
- Fixed the Graphs tab sometimes showing the wrong group's leaderboard numbers by making sure it waits for your group's data to be ready before loading them.
- Fixed the Activity Feed and Loot Log tabs sometimes going permanently stuck (no more loading, scrolling, or updates) after you'd navigated away from them once and come back.
- Fixed Loot Log session cards sometimes growing more loot after they'd already loaded, when scrolling further back added drops to a session you'd already seen.
- Loot Log's "load more" indicator no longer lingers forever near the bottom of a long history full of drop-less kills - it now gives up after a few empty attempts instead of implying there's always more to find.
- Fixed a case where a very long, uninterrupted farming session in the Loot Log could keep quietly adding loot to a session card you'd already scrolled past, instead of that card staying as you first saw it.
- Internal: fixed the new admin "Data management" member checkboxes not rendering.
- Royal Titans kills and loot now show up in the Activity Feed - they were silently being filtered out.
- Fixed the Boss KC graph on the Graphs tab showing a flat, wrong line instead of your group's actual kill counts.
- Fixed Loot Log kill sessions sometimes wrongly merging an old, late-arriving batch of kills in with a fresh session, making the count and time range for that boss look wrong.
- Royal Titans now has its boss icon everywhere it's shown, instead of a blank spot.
- Eldric the Ice King and Branda the Fire Queen (the two Royal Titans) now show a boss icon in the Activity Feed and Loot Log instead of a blank spot.
- Artio, Calvar'ion, Chaos Fanatic, Crazy Archaeologist, Deranged Archaeologist, Doom of Mokhaiotl, Hespori, Scurrius, Sol Heredit, Mad Angel, Maggot King, Shellbane Gryphon, The Mimic, and the Gauntlet/Corrupted Gauntlet bosses now show up in the Activity Feed with their boss icon - their kills and loot were being silently filtered out before.
- Spindel, the Royal Titans, Phosani's Nightmare, and Moons of Peril (Blood Moon, Blue Moon, Eclipse Moon) now show up in the Activity Feed with their boss icon instead of being silently filtered out.
- Fixed Royal Titans' boss icon not showing up anywhere on the site - it was never added despite earlier attempts to fix it.
- Corrected Doom of Mokhaiotl's combat level shown on its boss card - it was wrong.

## [1.0.299] - 2026-09-02

### Added
- Loot Log now has a single search box that finds drops by player, monster, item name, item value, quantity, or even monster combat level - try things like ">1m", "<500k", or a boss name. It loads more results automatically as you scroll instead of being limited to a fixed time window.
- Activity Feed entries now show the member's hue-coloured helmet icon in front of their name, matching the icon used on the map and side panels.

### Changed
- Loot Log entries older than 28 days are now automatically cleared out to keep things tidy.
- Loot Log now groups drops into farming sessions per player (kills within 45 minutes of each other), showing when each session started and ended, instead of lumping a boss's entire history into one block.
- Searching the Loot Log highlights the matching item in a session and fades the rest, making it easy to spot what you searched for.
- Health and prayer bars now stretch to fill the wider panel when you have the equipment tab open, instead of stopping short of the gear/stat columns.
- The Set Bonuses dialog now groups sets into Active, Partial, and a collapsed "Other Sets" list instead of one flat list, and set names link out to their OSRS Wiki page.
- Set Bonuses now tracks Shayzien armour (tier 5, full lizardman shaman poison reduction) and no longer lists Ferocious gloves, which was never a real set effect.
- Set Bonuses now covers every skilling outfit (Graceful, Carpenter's, Farmer's, Pyromancer, Angler's, Prospector, Zealot's, Raiments of the Eye, Smiths', Rogue, Lumberjack) as well as Bloodbark and Swampbark armour, on top of the combat sets it already tracked.
- Set Bonuses now shows each set's OSRS Wiki equipped-character image next to its entry, including all 6 Barrows sets - click a thumbnail to open that set's wiki page.
- Loot Log now shows two session cards side by side on wide screens instead of one long column, collapsing back to one per row on narrower screens.
- Leaderboards, the Graphs tab, session history, and the Loot Log's totals bar now load noticeably faster on a group with a lot of activity.

### Fixed
- Fixed uneven spacing around the item icon in Activity Feed collection log entries.
- Loot Log (and Activity Feed) could get stuck showing only the first page of results with the loading spinner spinning forever, or silently load an inconsistent amount depending on the page - scrolling now reliably keeps loading further results.
- Loot Log item icons within a session now line up in a fixed 10-per-row grid instead of reflowing unevenly based on available width.
- Loot Log's total gp value now sits directly above the item icons instead of floating off to the right of a wide panel.
- Fixed the demo group (/demo) failing to (re)seed on every deploy and scheduled refresh, which could leave it stuck unavailable.
- Fixed a rare case where scrolling the Loot Log (or Activity Feed) to load more could lock up the whole tab.
- Fixed Loot Log and Activity Feed sometimes loading nothing and getting stuck with a "Load more" that never worked, if you refreshed directly on that page.
- Loot Log and Activity Feed no longer show an endlessly-spinning loading icon once a page has actually finished loading - it only spins while genuinely fetching more, and sits still the rest of the time.

### Removed
- Removed the Loot Log's time window, boss, and member filter dropdowns - the new search box covers all of that in one place.

### Fixed
- Activity Feed collection log entries now show the item's own icon in front of its name, matching the "icon, item name, log book icon" order instead of stacking both icons after the name.
- Fixed the collection log item icon rendering oversized instead of at the same 18px size as the log book icon next to it.
- The "Boss kill" in-game chat notification no longer fires for every NPC kill (including slayer task mobs) - it's now limited to actual tracked bosses, matching what the setting says it does.
- Set Bonuses now defaults "Other Sets" open when you have no active or partial sets, instead of hiding everything behind a collapsed accordion.
- Set Bonuses is now scrollable again when its contents overflow the dialog, including when the "Other Sets" list is long.
- Set Bonuses' wiki links for the 6 Barrows sets and 3 Moon sets now go to the actual equipment page instead of the Grand Exchange trading-bundle page, which doesn't describe the set effect at all.

## [1.0.257] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- Activity Feed now posts a standalone announcement when a member finishes every combat achievement task for a specific boss, the same way finishing a collection log page already does.
- Group Settings now has a Discord Integration section — paste in a channel webhook URL and GroupScape can post your group's kills, deaths, loot, notable drops, and raid completions straight to Discord, with a toggle for each one. Saving sends a live test message first, so a bad or deleted webhook is caught immediately instead of silently failing later.
- Discord boss kill notifications now show the total GE value of what the boss dropped, e.g. "killed Zulrah (KC: 45) — loot worth 1,204,300 gp".
- The Activity Feed now shows raid completions for Chambers of Xeric, Theatre of Blood, and Tombs of Amascut, including who finished it, the difficulty (invocation level for Tombs of Amascut, mode for the other two), and how much the reward chest was worth. If several of you finish the same raid together, it shows up as one entry crediting everyone instead of one per person. Raids also get their own filter chip and toast notification, and Tombs of Amascut shows a different icon depending on the invocation level reached.
- Graphs now has a "Raid Completions" option alongside XP and Boss KC, showing your group's Chambers of Xeric, Theatre of Blood, and Tombs of Amascut completions over time. Filter by raid and (for CoX/ToA) by difficulty, and switch between one combined group line or a line per member - the leaderboard panel ranks members by how many of those completions they were part of.
- Loot Log tiles now show a small helmet badge (tinted to each member's color) for who got the drop when "All members" is selected. An item dropped by more than one member is combined into a single tile with a stacked badge and a per-member breakdown in the tooltip, instead of one duplicate tile per member. Boss kill sources also get their chathead icon next to the name.
- Loot Log summary now shows a session card - the time span from your first kill to your last within the selected window, plus the duration.
- Each Loot Log source now shows its own first-kill-to-last-kill time range next to the kill count, so a boss farmed across several days shows that span instead of just a total.
- Clicking a Loot Log item now opens its OSRS Wiki page in a new tab.
- Loot Log boss names now show their combat level (e.g. "Vorkath (level-732)"), matching the in-game overhead format, for bosses with one fixed level.
- Group Settings' Discord Integration section now has toggles for Combat achievements, Collection log, Quest completions, and Diary completions, so those milestones can post to Discord too.

### Changed
- Activity Feed kill entries now show the boss's icon next to its name, and repeated kills of the same boss by the same member within an hour merge into one entry with a running count (e.g. "killed Vorkath ×3") instead of listing each kill separately - the same merging applies to a kill toast that's still on screen.
- Loot Log now groups drops by boss, chest, or clue tier under a square icon grid instead of a flat list, with a rarity-colored border on each item and a hover tooltip showing its name and value. Each source shows its own total value alongside a kill/open/casket count. Loot splitting and the per-person breakdown have been removed - Loot Log is just a log now.
- Loot Log item art now has a lot more breathing room inside its rarity border instead of crowding the edge.
- The Loot Log time window's "Last day" option is now labeled "Last 24h".
- Activity Feed entries for new collection log items now show the item's own icon next to the collection log icon, and link out to that item's OSRS Wiki page.
- Activity Feed's left-hand rail now filters by activity type (kills, raids, collection log, clues, etc.) and the pills at the top now filter by member - swapped from before, where it was the other way around.
- Discord's "Loot" and "Notable drops" toggles are now a single "Drops" toggle with an adjustable minimum value (250k gp by default) - only drops worth at least that amount get posted.
- Discord's "Kills" notification is now "Boss kills" and only fires for actual bosses, not regular NPCs, and now includes the member's kill count for that boss.
- Discord kill and drop messages now show the item's real name, linked to its OSRS Wiki page, instead of "item #12345".
- Loot Log now defaults to the last 24h instead of the last hour when you open it.
- Discord "Drops" messages now show each item's value (or "untradeable" if it has none) and its drop rate when known, and value now reflects the whole stack - 33x a 100gp item shows as 3,300 gp, not 100 gp.
- Loot Log's Source filter now only lists sources you've actually looted in the selected date range, instead of every boss and chest in the game - picking a different date range updates the list, and it's empty if nothing was looted in that range.
- Internal: fixed the commit workflow doc so it can't cause the version number to double-bump on a single commit.

### Fixed
- Loot Log items dropped by a boss with no curated rarity data no longer show up as "Item #12345" - the real item name is shown.
- Loot Log items GroupScape doesn't recognize (no name, image, or value on file) no longer render as broken empty tiles - they're hidden instead.
- Loot Log items from the same kill no longer reshuffle their order every time the page refreshes.
- Coin drops in the Loot Log no longer value at 0gp.
- Loot Log boss, chest, and clue-tier icons now use the same small square icon as RuneLite's Hiscore panel (and the official OSRS hiscores page), self-hosted instead of hotlinked so they always load.
- Test/diagnostic kill data no longer shows up in the Loot Log.
- Untradeable items in the Loot Log now show an "Untradeable" tag in their tooltip instead of "0 gp x quantity".
- The "Exit view" button on the admin read-only viewing banner no longer fails to click while looking at the Map tab.
- Activity Feed's type and member filter counts no longer zero out every other option when you pick a filter - they now show real counts for each choice regardless of what's currently selected.
- The Discord notify toggles in Group Settings were invisible and couldn't be clicked at all - fixed.
- Kills, loot, and deaths could occasionally show up twice in the Activity Feed and get posted twice to Discord, most often right around a server restart - fixed.
- Activity Feed no longer gets stuck endlessly spinning for a group with a long same-boss farming streak - when merging repeat kills keeps pulling in more history without adding anything new to see, it now pauses and shows a "Load more" button instead of spinning forever.
- Activity Feed no longer breaks entirely (spinner stuck forever) when a kill's loot includes an item GroupScape doesn't recognize yet - that item is now just skipped instead of crashing the whole feed.
- Activity Feed for an account with a long, near-continuous kill history against the same boss no longer keeps auto-loading page after page trying to catch up - it now stops after a handful of pages and shows a "Load more" button instead of spinning indefinitely.

## [1.0.254] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- Loot Log was always empty - every kill report from the plugin was silently rejected by the server, so no kill or loot ever got recorded. Kills (and their loot) now save properly.

## [1.0.253] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Graphs now has 1H, 6H, and 12H time period options, alongside the existing 24H/7D/30D/1Y.

### Changed
- Simplified the top nav's account menu into a plain divider next to the tab row, instead of a floating panel — fixes it occasionally overlapping page content on Activity Feed, Combat Achievements, and Loot Log.

## [1.0.248] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- GP Earned now tracks your total wealth - bank, inventory, and worn gear combined - instead of just your bank, so it shows a true day-to-day gp gain or loss.

### Fixed
- Boss KC now actually records kills. Previously most boss kills, especially ones with longer death animations, were never counted.

### Removed
- The Loot Value graph and leaderboard option, which never had any data, have been removed.

## [1.0.246] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Raid markers on the map now include four numbered (1-4) and four lettered (A-D) generic callouts, alongside Danger/Defend/Loot/Focus.

### Changed
- Renamed the "Safe Spot" raid marker to "Defend".

[1.0.245] — Fix Menu Overlap On Activity Feed, Loot Log, Graphs Leaderboard

## [1.0.243] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- The target HP bar in the roster no longer looks short of full when you're talking to or banking with an NPC.

## [1.0.241] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- The Activity Feed and Loot Log pages now use the full width of the screen instead of staying narrow and centered, matching the Items page.

## [1.0.238] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- The loot log page is simpler now - the clue tier, sort, and accounting-mode filters are gone, and drops are always listed most-recent-first.

## [1.0.235] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Clue casket completions now show up in the activity feed, with the clue tier, total casket value in gp, and a clue scroll icon.

## [1.0.233] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- The "Combat Achievements" tab in the top nav no longer gets crowded out by the account menu on narrower screens.

## [1.0.231] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- On mobile, the player stats panel could no longer be closed by tapping outside it without also blocking taps on the buttons and tabs inside the panel itself.

## [1.0.229] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- The Combat Achievements member list and the group settings colour picker now show each member's actual helmet icon, tinted to their chosen colour, instead of a plain initial or a hand-drawn helmet shape.

## [1.0.227] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- The group map now shows raid markers (Danger, Safe Spot, Loot, Focus/Kill Target) dropped by teammates in-game, with the same icon they see in RuneLite.

## [1.0.226] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- Fixed clearing a ping (and pings ending automatically) silently failing every time.

## [1.0.225] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- The ping toast now stays on screen for 20 seconds instead of 6, so there's actually time to click it before it disappears.

## [1.0.222] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Dropping a ping now pops a quick toast for everyone in the group - click it to jump straight to that spot on the map.

## [1.0.221] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Group members can now drop pings on the map that everyone in the group sees live, both in-game and on the website map, laying the groundwork for the upcoming right-click/hotkey ping feature in the RuneLite plugin.

## [1.0.71] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- Internal: fixed the deploy pipeline so the Discord patch-notes bot can find the server's deploy folder, so it stops reporting "no changes" on every real release.

## [1.0.70] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- Fixed the RuneLite plugin's live party overlay and side panel not showing other group members, even though they showed up fine as online on the website. A routing mix-up on the server meant the plugin's real-time connection request and character-linking request were quietly being rejected.

## [1.0.69] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- Internal: the live group vitals feed now also carries each member's map position, laying the groundwork for the upcoming RuneLite plugin feature that shows group members on the in-game world map and minimap.

## [1.0.68] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- Fixed a group member's active prayer icons sometimes staying visible after they logged out.

## [1.0.67] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- Fixed the account page's online badge showing a group member as offline after a minute of standing idle even though their client was still checking in fine.

## [1.0.66] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Activity feed now shows icons for quest completions, combat achievement tiers, diary entries, and collection log additions.

### Changed
- Combat Achievements tab now fills the full page width like Graphs does, with bigger progress bars, per-tier percentages, and a group-average summary row.
- Character avatars and text on the Account > Characters page are bigger and easier to read.

### Fixed
- Fixed group members incorrectly showing as offline while idle (standing still, AFK skilling, etc.) even though RuneLite was still connected and sending updates fine.
- Added logging around the live party-overlay connection so future connection drops are easier to diagnose (no user-facing change).
- Group Settings no longer shows your personal account token in place of your group's real invite token when you open it via Account > Characters — the Copy button is disabled with an explanation until you reroll for a real, shareable one.
- Discord boss kill notifications now show your account's real in-game kill count instead of how many times GroupScape happened to see that boss's kill logged on its own server.

## [1.0.65] - 2026-08-28

### Removed
- Removed farming patch and bird house timers tracking from the site and Timers page.

## [1.0.64] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- Deploys now automatically post a summary of what changed to Discord.
